There are differences in the kinetic outputs (KneeMoment_x and AnklePower) of the original and updated version (v1.3.4+) of biomechZoo. 
The overall curves remain very similar, but a notable change is observed near foot off for the coronal plane knee moments, providing a closer agreement 
with Vicon outputs. This change modifies p-values reported in the original paper and accompanying SPSS outputs, but not the interpretation. Data should match values in eventval_new.xls.
